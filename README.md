# Golang for bioinformatics

## About Golang

Wikipedia:

> Open source programming language created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer,
 Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
 It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C,
 with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features
 and CSP-style concurrent programming features added

Official site: [https://golang.org/](https://golang.org/)

### Advantages

  部署简单，跨平台编译。Go编译生成各流行操作系统的二进制文件，直接运行即可，无依赖。

- High performance.

  高性能。

- Statically Typeed.

  静态类型语言。

- Concurrency of language level.

  语言级别的并发支持。

- Good language design, full tool-chain

  关键字少，语法简单，工具链完善。

- Embedded runtime, has Garbage Collection.

  内置runtime，支持GC。
